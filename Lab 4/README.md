Lab 4 - Deep Reinforcement Learning

The goal of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with the RL Algorithms.The task was to test a variety of enviroments for the Atari game UpNDown and choose the best RL Algorithm. Furthermore we recorded our best agent playing the Atari game to see the results that our best model provided.
