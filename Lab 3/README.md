Lab 3 - Deep Learning

The goal of this lab was to develop an Image Classifier on CIFAR-100 dataset using deep neural networks. We also used Transfer Learning on some well known architectures and on the state-of-the-art EfficientNets. Additionally we had to build some models from scratch for the same task.
