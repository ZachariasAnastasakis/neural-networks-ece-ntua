Lab 2 - Unsupervised Learning

The goal of this lab was to develop a movie recommender system with content-based filtering, focusing on the corpuses of the movies, using Somoclu's library to create Self Organizing Maps (SOM) and cluster our movies based on their genres. For this lab we use a subset of the Carnegie Mellon Movie Summary Corpus dataset.
